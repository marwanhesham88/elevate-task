# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Approach
- Used [technology stack] to build the frontend.
- Modular component structure for better maintainability.
- Implemented state management using [e.g., React's useState, useEffect].
- Ensured responsive design using [e.g., Tailwind CSS].

Challenges
- API Integration: Managed async operations and rendering issues.
- Cross-browser Compatibility: Fixed inconsistencies across different browsers.
- State Management: Optimized re-rendering and state flow between components.

How to Run Locally
1- npm create vite@latest
